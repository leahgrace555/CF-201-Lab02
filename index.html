      <p>
        I hail from California, having moved to Seattle in 2005. I first became interested in software development, and computer science in general, in 2011.

        After being intested in topics like physics, mathematics, cosmology, literature, astrophysics, philosophy, and astronomy (both amateur and research) all my life, I asked myself around 2011 what all those things had in common. The answer was: information density. I adore anything that presents complex ideas elegantly and succintly. Considering what to do with that realization, it struck me that software development could be a rewarding path.

        Several years, a few interrupted starts, and one <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/flounds/id1059196121">iOS app</a> later, I am finally pursuing becoming a Software Developer full time with Code Fellows.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am primarily interested in back-end development. I enjoy building things that perform complex tasks.
